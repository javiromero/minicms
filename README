Really simple cms to create landing pages

There are two sample settings files included:
    * one for the main minicms project
    * one for the plantillas or 'templates' project

This project aims at creating several landing pages reusing minicms main application,
so you can create several sites, configure some contact data, analytics codes, colors,
home page, some additional pages (no levels or hierachies) and serve them.

You can also create a copy from the plantillas folder and customize the templates used
for the pages. It will reuse minicms code to resolve urls, views, models and admin.

The project has the following dependencies:

    * django=1.3.1
    * south=0.7.3
    * sorl-thumbnail

You can satisfy them using

    pip install -r requirements.txt
